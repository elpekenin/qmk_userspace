# :warning: Not a real fork of `qmk_userspace` :warning:

This repository uses a custom build system to compile my firmware, because by board is a 1-off I built for myself and will not be PR'ed to `qmk_firmware`.

This is only a fork of `qmk_userspace` on GitHub for visibility reasons (perhaps somebody runs into it and finds something useful)
